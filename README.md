# ADHD-EEG-signal-classification
Our project is Binary EEG signal classification using 1-D CNN deep learning model\
We are classifying our signal into control and ADHD\
the dataset was aquired from [IEEEDataPort EEG data for ADHD / control children](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/eeg-data-adhd-control-children)\
